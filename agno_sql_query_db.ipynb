    "## Behind the Scenes\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this possible is AGNO's SQLTools integration. When you ask a question in natural language:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model interprets your question\n",
    "2. The SQLTools component translates it into a valid SQL query\n",
    "3. The query executes against your database\n",
    "4. Results are formatted and returned to you\n",
    "\n",
    "AGNO handles all the complexity of query generation, database connections, and result formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of This Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessibility**: Non-technical users can query databases\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Works with complex SQL operations (joins, aggregations, filtering)\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Faster than writing SQL queries manually, especially for complex reports\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: The same pattern works for other database engines (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "With just a few lines of code, AGNO allows you to create an AI agent that can interpret natural language queries and execute appropriate SQL commands. This approach simplifies database interaction and can be extended to more complex database scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite's lightweight nature makes it perfect for prototyping and small applications, while AGNO's flexibility allows it to work with various database systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment with more complex queries\n",
    "- Connect to larger databases\n",
    "- Add memory capabilities to your agent\n",
    "- Combine with other AGNO tools for more capabilities\n",
